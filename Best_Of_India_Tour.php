                                                    ideal combination of the ancient and the contemporary era. Delhi has
                                                    two visible parts: a) New Delhi, the city created by the British, as
                                                    the royal capital of India in 1911. b) The Old Delhi which was
                                                    considered as the Muslim capital of India between the 17th and the
                                                    19th century. There are at least eight cities on the location of
                                                    modern Delhi among which Indraprastha is one of the first recognized
                                                    settlements, highlighted in the epic Mahabharata over 3000 years
                                                    ago. Nevertheless, Delhi has always been one of the major cities in
                                                    the northern region of the subcontinent.

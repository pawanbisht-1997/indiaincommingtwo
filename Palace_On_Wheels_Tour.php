                                                <li>The first stop on your Palace on Wheels journey is Jaipur. It is the
                                                    capital of Rajasthan, and is known as the “Pink City” because of the
                                                    pink tinted constructions in the old city. It is situated on a dry
                                                    lake bed, bordered by barren hills vanquished by forts and broken
                                                    walls. The city was found in 1727 by Maharaja Jai Singh II.

                                                <li>An air-conditioned coach takes you to Hawa Mahal or the Palace of
                                                    Winds, which was constructed by Maharaja Sawaj pratap Singh in 1799,
                                                    the Hawa Mahal, is one of the Jaipur’s main landmarks; the front of
                                                    the Mahal has pink windows and latticework screens. This Mahal was
                                                    initially constructed for the ladies of the imperial household to
                                                    watch the ordinary life and parades of the city. After visiting Hawa

                                                    located 11 kms away from Jaipur. Amber was once the ancient capital
                                                    of Jaipur. The Fort is an excellent illustration of Rajput
                                                    architecture, impressively situated on a hillside facing a lake,
                                                    which reflects its walkways and walls. Later lunch at a 5 star hotel

                                                    named after its founder Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I. After a
                                                    relaxing breakfast, a visit to the Ranthambore National Park is
                                                    arranged. This wildlife sanctuary is one of the major illustrations
                                                    of the Project Tiger's conservation in Rajasthan. The Ranthambore
                                                    National Park covers an area of over 400 sq. km. It has many sharp
                                                    cliffs enfolding a route of lakes and rivers. The 10th century
                                                    Ranthambore Fort stands as a silent watchman on one of these hills.
                                                    This National Park is a combination of the fortified forest and the
                                                    open chaparral land. The Ranthambore National Park is naturally a
                                                    dry deciduous type of forest. Dhok is the most noticeable tree in
                                                    the forest. Since, Ranthambore is a tiger reserve, glimpses of
                                                    tigers are very common in this area, apart from that, the park has a
                                                    few panthers too. Kachida Valley is known to be the best place to
                                                    have a glimpse of these exclusive cats. One can also find marsh
                                                    crocodiles, hyenas, jungle cats and the sloth bears. The avian
                                                    population includes the black storks, quails, Bonelli’s eagles; spur
                                                    fowls, crested serpent eagles and painted storks. During the
                                                    winters, there are a lot of migratory birds in the forest, including
                                                    a different variety of ducks. The National Park is well known for

                                              <li>Udaipur, literally meaning “the city of Sunrise”, was established by a Rajput King, Maharana Uday Singh, in 1567, and this city is now also known as the “City of Lakes” and also the “Venice of the East”.
                                            </li>
                                              <li>Udaipur is a moony lake city with its marble whims, attractive hibiscus-covered gardens and elegant fountain porches, which symbolize the glory of Rajput era. Like many other cities in Rajasthan, Udaipur is the heirloom of an honor-bound race that loved the good things in life and often gave up their lives protecting them. The most beautiful sites of Udaipur are the marble palace, the Jag Niwas (Lake Palace) and the Jagdish Mandir, which rises from the blue waters of Lake Pichola. After lunch at a 5 star hotel, continue your visit to the City Palace.

It is called the golden city of the Thar Desert, because yellow sand and yellow sandstone is used in most of the buildings in the city. Jaisalmer was declared a National Heritage City in 1974 and since then the town has been very well maintained and protected for the pleasure of the tourists. The vicinity of Jaisalmer is the residence for many rare desert flora and fauna. The Nathmalji-ki-haveli, Patwon-ki-haveli and Salim Singh-ki-haveli are fine examples of the stone carver's skill. After lunch on board, go for an exciting camel ride on the sand dunes of Sam. Enjoy the dinner and the cultural program at a 5 star hotel.

The lively desert city of Jodhpur stands at the fringe of the Thar Desert and is the second major city of Rajasthan after Jaipur. The city is differentiated by a huge fort that covers a sheer rocky ridge rising in the heart of the town. The old city is still delimited by a 10 km long wall, made about a century after Jodhpur was established. There are eight gates leading out of the old city. You can take a stroll through the beautiful winding streets. The city of Jodhpur was founded in 1459 by Rao Jodha, the chief of a Rajput clan known as Rathores and was earlier called Marwar. Near the fort complex is the Jaswant Thaada, and a group of royal monuments made of white marble. After lunch at a Palace hotel, return to the Palace on Wheels.
